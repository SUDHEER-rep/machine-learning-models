# faces.py and faces_train.py (detect faces in real time from inbuilt camera)
    In faces_train.py we train the model with the images in folder named images(order the images into respective folder with name of the person for example if there are 7 images of trump collect them in one folder named trump. 
    then run the faces.py to see the output.
    
# object detection.py(this model is based on yolo algorithm:real time object detection)
   this has a pre trained model you first have to save model then load yolov3 weights which are available from darknet.
   
# glasess and stash.py
   this model detect the eyes in real time and attaches spectacles.
